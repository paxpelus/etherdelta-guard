# etherdelta-guard

This chrome extension verifies the integrity of etherdelta.com resources such as the index.html and some .js files. This is done by comparing the md5 code of some files on github vs etherdelta.com

If the extension icon turns red this means that one or more files have been changed on the etherdelta.com domain.

You can find the Google Chrome extension in the following url https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etherdelta-guard/fdemngobohaebajiadodhhlbfmfnmafp

Follow the steps in the following url to enable the extension in Developer Mode (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)

Thanks Zack Coburn for his support, he is kind enough to init an update on EtherDelta Guard extension every time he updates his code.
